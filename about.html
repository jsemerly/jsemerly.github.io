                <p>
                  My name is Jacqueline ‘J’ Semerly. I was born August of 2002 in the
                  outskirts of Chicago; Skokie, Illinois. My family quickly relocated to
                  Lansing, Michigan where I lived with my Yiayia (grandmother) before
                  finally settling in the suburb of Okemos, Michigan to begin schooling.
                  My ethnic background plays a major part in who I am and how I was
                  raised. My father is the son of an immigrant mother, who came to
                  Lansing, from Greece to flee wartime oppression. I spent 7+ years in
                  “greek school” learning the language and culture through my Orthodox
                  church. I’ve always kept a busy schedule, maintaining my grades in
                  school, playing year-round competitive sports, and fostering meaningful
                  connections. The rigor and discipline I have been able to keep up
                  throughout my life have carved me into the independent, determined, and
                  albeit stubborn person I am today. But it is these characteristics that
                  have taken me all the way to Babson.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  I have so luckily been blessed to experience the most wonderful and
                  inviting community here at Babson. I touched down on campus as a
                  freshman and was welcomed with open arms by countless programs, groups,
                  and peers. Today, as a graduating senior, I can proudly say I have
                  retained the same group of friends that I met on day one of my college
                  experience. The four of us soon became inseparable, and it has been as
                  such ever since. That very week I met my boyfriend who I began dating a
                  few months after, and we remain a strong couple today, nearly four years
                  later. The educational experience at Babson has been just as wonderful.
                  I have had the opportunity to learn from, and amongst, the most
                  knowledgeable figures of their respective fields. FME, although a lot of
                  work, showed me right away that whatever it is I choose to pursue, I
                  have the toolbox and the ability to make it happen. Through all the
                  helpful technical skills I have picked up at Babson, the most important
                  takeaways are life lessons. My mindset has completely changed since
                  being here; I have more confidence in my abilities and have allowed
                  myself to be proud of my accolades and celebrate my work ethic. I know
                  now, entrepreneurs are no smarter than you or I, they just put action
                  behind their ideas, and took those first steps forward.

                  I can’t remember a time in my life when I didn’t play sports – I was
                  holding a tennis racquet from the moment I was able to pick one up on my
                  own. I spent years in tennis, teeball, ballet, soccer, golf, gymnastics,
                  and volleyball, but found my spot on the
                  <a href="https://www.hudl.com/profile/14011689/JACQUELINE-SEMERLY"
                    >basketball</a
                  >
                  court to be home. I began playing basketball year round in the fourth
                  grade; Travel basketball beginning in the fall, school season beginning
                  in the winter, straight into playing with the travel team again for the
                  spring, and then tournaments and pick up leagues throughout the summer.
                  In 7th grade I got an injury in a game that set me back in my sport - I
                  lost the majority of mobility in my dominant forearm, and thus lost my
                  ability to shoot the ball. I taught myself to shoot left-handed, and
                  rehabbed my dominant right arm, all the while, never missing practice,
                  and even playing in the games while my right arm was unusable. I then
                  re-taught myself how to shoot with my dominant arm, now lacking the
                  mobility I once had, and set myself back on track after years of hard
                  work. By high school, I had achieved my childhood dream of making the
                  varsity basketball team as a freshman, and then surpassing that goal by
                  going on to make the starting 5 lineup by the end of the season. Come
                  spring of that year, I ended up on the varsity tennis team, while
                  continuing with my spring travel season as well. Basketball is actually
                  the reason I am here at Babson. Coach Judy Blinstrub, veteran coach at
                  Babson, recruited me in my junior year of highschool to come play for
                  the Beavers. Deciding it was a perfect fit, Babson was the one and only
                  school I applied for - and I’m glad things worked out. After my freshman
                  year, I decided to end my basketball career to further my professional
                  career.

                  My other passion in life has always been art. As a kid, if I wasn’t in
                  school or playing sports, I was likely making art. I got serious about
                  drawing in middle school, where I used my sister’s hand-me-down art
                  supplies to make pencil drawings. As my art developed, the number one
                  comment I got on my designs was “that should be a tattoo”. So in
                  highschool, I bought a tattoo gun and self taught myself to make art in
                  this new medium. Today, I still do
                  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monstersinkta2/">tattoos</a>, and
                  plan to get a license one day… I swear.
